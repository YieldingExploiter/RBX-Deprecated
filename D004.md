[Developer Refrence](Method?Instance/Remove)

The [Instance](Class?Instance):[Remove()](Method?Instance/Remove) function is deprecated in favour of [Instance](Class?Instance):[Destroy()](Method?Instance/Destroy) and [Instance](Class?Instance):[ClearAllChildren()](Method?Instance/ClearAllChildren), which should be used in new work instead.

From the Developer Refrence:

> The [Remove](Method?Instance/Remove) function sets the objectâ€™s [Instance](Class?Instance).[Parent](Prop?Instance/Parent) to [nil](Article?Nil), and does the same for all its descendants.
> 
> If the object is referenced before being removed, it is possible to retrieve the object at a later point.


## Examples
Deprecated:
```lua
instance:Remove();
-- or
instance:remove();
```

Not Deprecated:
```lua
instance:Destroy();
```
