# D007
The AstolfoBrew `loadBytecodeSync()` and `loadBytecodeAsync()` functions are deprecated and will be removed before Release [AstolfoBrew/Astolfo#6](https://github.com/AstolfoBrew/Astolfo/issues/6).<br/>
Please avoid using this method for new work.<br/>

## Timeline
Here's a mini-timeline of this function:
> 2.8.2.1: loadBytecode Introduced (`c53066c`)
> 2.8.3.0: loadBytecodeAsync Introduced (`f753e24`)
> 2.23.1.0: Deprecate `loadBytecodeSync` and `loadBytecodeAsync`
> 2.23.2.0: Planned removal of `loadBytecodeAsync`
> 2.23.3.0: Planned removal of `loadBytecodeSync`
> 3.0.0.0: Latest removal of `loadBytecodeAsync` and `loadBytecodeSync`

## Alternatives
Since `loadBytecode(A)Sync` only accepted AstolfoBrew-encrypted Bytecode, an alternative would be to load a different AstolfoBrew-Obfuscated Script using `loadstring` or a custom LBI.

## Motivation
`LoadBytecode(A)Sync` exposed the LBI to the lua input directly, allowing you to perform unsafe things with the LBI directly.<br/>
This would let a spawned process kill the main process' main thread by erroring.

Additionally, this would cause every `Opcode` to be included in the final output, regardless of if the function was used or not.

In future, we might add something similar to a
```lua
--!ASTOLFO-LOADBYTECODE-ENABLED
```
flag.
