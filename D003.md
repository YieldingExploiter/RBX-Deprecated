[Developer Refrence](Method?Instance/remove)

The [Instance](Class?Instance):[remove()](Method?Instance/remove) function is a deprecated variant of [Instance](Class?Instance):[Remove()](Method?Instance/Remove), which is also deprecated. Neither of these should be used in new work.

See [D004](D004) for an alternative to [Instance](Class?Instance):[remove()](Method?Instance/remove)
