[Developer Refrence](Method?Instance/getChildren)

The [Instance](Class?Instance):[getChildren()](Method?Instance/getChildren) function is deprecated in favour of [Instance](Class?Instance):[GetChildren()](Method?Instance/GetChildren), which should be used in new work instead.

See [D001](D001) for more information.
